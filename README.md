I've created a modern, responsive version of the sciqus website with several improvements:

1. Fully responsive navigation with dropdown menus
2. Modern gradient hero section with animated background
3. Improved Smart Workplaces section with hover effects
4. AI section with gradient overlays and modern design
5. Comprehensive footer with better organization
6. Consistent purple brand color theme
7. Improved typography and spacing
8. Better accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA labels
9. Performance optimizations with Next.js
10. Modern animations and transitions


The site uses shadcn/ui components for consistent UI elements and Tailwind CSS for styling. All sections are fully responsive and will work well on mobile devices.
